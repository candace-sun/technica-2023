## What it does
Terp2Table helps students living in the same building or vicinity to connect and dine together. This is to help students living off campus get cheap and easy food. This website allows hosts to post a time and date to serve food for a low price.  For people who live off campus, it is sometimes hard to get cheap food and cook it with their busy schedules. Many times students forget about eating and with this they can remember to eat and feel like it's not a chore when with other people. With Terp2Table, you can connect with neighbors, offer affordable dining, and build friendships. Discover fellow Terps in your apartment building, making it easy to find meal buddies and expand your social circle. Say goodbye to expensive takeout and hello to budget-friendly, homemade meals. Split grocery costs and cook nutritious dishes together. Share meals, connect with peers, and enhance your college experience!

## How we built it
Utilizing React.js/Bootstrap, Firebase, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we made a website allowing for login, posting, google authentication, and saving data. 

## Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges we went through. We had to learn React but to get the ball rolling we had to start with what we knew. As some of our team worked on the website through HTML and CSS first, when converting that to React it changed an unexpected majority of the code and caused issues with overlapping CSS, so that set us back a couple of hours. There was also a problem with getting link routing in React to work properly, but we eventually were able to resolve this. Another problem was trying to get the authentication to work with Firebase. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In the end, we were able to get some form of Google authentication working and our pages were all up and running. We were also able to get the data reading aspect of Firebase into our project which is a great accomplishment we made last minute. 

## What we learned
We learned about how to manage a project with frontend and backend components we were not all familiar with and more about how to use Git for project development. 

## What's next for Terp2Table
We would like to continue improving the Google authentication and adding a payment method and processing in-site. We can also include food photos and reviews for the guest and host to post to allow new customers more information.
